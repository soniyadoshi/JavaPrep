 * Emma is playing a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds.
 * Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus.
 * She can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the
 * number of the current cloud plus  or . She must avoid the thunderheads.
 * Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take Emma to jump from her starting postion to the last cloud.
 * It is always possible to win the game.

For each game, Emma will get an array of clouds numbered  if they are safe or
* if they must be avoided.
* For example,  indexed from .
* The number on each cloud is its index in the list so she must avoid the clouds at indexes  and .
* She could follow the following two paths:  or . The first path takes jumps while the second takes .
